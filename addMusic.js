// Part One

// Read from local JSON file with jQuery.
// Loop over results and inject into Music History list view.
// Add delete button DOM to each row and, when it is clicked, delete the entire row in the DOM.
// Part Two

// Take your music and split it into two JSON file instead of them all living on one file.
// Add a button at the bottom of your music list and label it "More >".
// Load the songs from the first list and inject the DOM into the document as you've already done.
// When the user clicks that button, load the songs from the second JSON file and append them to the bottom of the existing music, but before the More button.
